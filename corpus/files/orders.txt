jump
die
run
live
don't be a pussy
don't be a jerk
don't be so weak 
don't be sad 
don't be so sad 
trust in you 
trust in me 
don't worry  
be happy
be nice 
be positive
be beautiful
trust in life
trust in the beauty of earth
trust in the universe 
believe in gravity
believe in youself
do it
just do it
fall down 
now
don't jump 
don't die
don't cry
forgive yourslef
forget your dog
forget you grand-dad 
step off
go on
go back
calm down
stop crying now
